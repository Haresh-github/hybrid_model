# Hybrid Search Model for Tabular Data
This project implements a hybrid search model that combines semantic search and fuzzy logic to match user queries against tabular data stored in an Excel file. The model utilizes the SentenceTransformer library for generating embeddings and fuzzywuzzy for fuzzy string matching, providing a robust solution for data retrieval tasks.


## Features
1) Hybrid Search: Combines semantic similarity (using sentence embeddings) and fuzzy string matching for enhanced search capabilities.
2) Batch Processing: Efficiently processes large datasets by encoding data in batches.
3) Modular Codebase: The code is modular, making it easy to maintain and extend.
4) Customizable: Easily adjustable to handle different file formats and query types.

## Requirements
* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.11.9
* Pandas
* Sentence Transformers
* FuzzyWuzzy
* NumPy
